Online Now is a very small plugin that will help you to show which registred users are online now

== Description ==

This plugin was created because of a problem I've ran into when I was working on a theme then I created a [post on my Blog with a video]() about the problem.

As this is a plugin created just to solve a simple problem it's just a single file Plugin, and it is very very light.

As soon as I can I will try to reproduce and if verified I will mark it as `Confirmed` then I will try to resolve it.
